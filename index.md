## Background

I received my PhD from [University of Tennessee](https://bredesencenter.utk.edu), advised by [Dr. Jitendra Kumar](https://climatemodeling.org/~jkumar/) and [Dr. Forrest Hoffman](https://climatemodeling.org/~forrest/). I did my masters in civil engineering at Penn State in University Park, PA, advised by [Dr. Michael Gooseff](http://goosefflab.weebly.com/).

In the past, I have spent time at Virgina Tech working on machine learning projects for national security and Boeing Research & Technology developing geospatial analytics projects for the aerospace industry.

## Research Interests

I enjoy working on integrating multiple sources of data for understanding complex problems, which may include anomaly detection in engineering systems, dynamic modeling of systems, up-scaling field measurements for image classification, and algorithm development for noisy/under-sampled datasets (e.g., few-shot learning).
