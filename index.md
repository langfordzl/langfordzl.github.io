# Welcome!

Hi! I'm Zach Langford. 

I'm currently R&D Associate at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov)   in the Cyber and Applied Data Analytics Division. 

I received my PhD from [University of Tennessee](https://bredesencenter.utk.edu), where I was advised by [Dr. Jitendra Kumar](https://climatemodeling.org/~jkumar/) and [Dr. Forrest Hoffman](https://climatemodeling.org/~forrest/). I did my masters in civil engineering at Penn State in University Park, PA, where I worked with [Dr. Michael Gooseff](http://goosefflab.weebly.com/).

In the past, I have spent time at Virgina Tech, where I worked on projects related to machine learning applications for national security. I also spent time at Boeing Research & Technology, working on geospatial analytics projects related to the aerospace industry.

I enjoy working on integrating multiple sources of data for understanding complex problems. These problems may include anomaly detection in engineering systems, up-scaling field measurements for image classification, and algorithm development for noisy/under-sampled datasets.
